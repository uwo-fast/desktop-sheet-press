# Nano_KiCAD

KiCAD porting of Arduino Nano V3.3 PCB design.

The original project was made for EAGLE v7. The schematic, PCB and some of the symbols/footprints are slightly modified to avoid ERC/DRC errors/warnings.

## Acknowledgement

The original project was downloaded from [Arduino Official Store](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano).

3D models in the [NanoV3.3.3dshapes](NanoV3.3.3dshapes) directory are works of others.
