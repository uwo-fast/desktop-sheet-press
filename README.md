# Open Source Scientidic Sheet Press: General Overview

## Description

The Open Source Scientific Sheet Press is a mechanical device engineered for converting plastic waste into flat sheets of recycled plastic. Drawing inspiration from existing models like Precious Plastics, this platform is designed with adaptability, flexibility, and sustainability as core principles.

### About the FAST Research Group

The Free Appropriate Sustainable Technology (FAST) research group, led by Professor Joshua Pearce, is based at Western University and focuses on driving sustainability innovations. The group works on a myriad of projects ranging from solar photovoltaic technology to alternative food to open-source hardware to distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM).

This Open Source Sheet Press project is an initiative led by the FAST group, aligning with our broader goals of sustainable development and open-source technology. We are focused on developing solutions that not only contribute to recycling and sustainable manufacturing but also push the boundaries of what's possible through continuous research and innovation.
