# GUI Usage

The GUI is based on a 2x16 LCD and a button rotary encoder. The main screen displays the temperatures, set temperature, outputs, and remaining time, while the options screen allows user control over the process variables.

While on the main screen, click the button once to enter the options screen. This will place you on the top "Back" line, which can be single-clicked again to return to the main menu. In the options menu, you can use the encoder to scroll up or down and single-click the button to select a variable. Once a variable is selected, it can be incremented/decremented by scrolling the value using the encoder. Once you are done modifying the variable, single-click again to deselect the item and return to navigating the menu with the cursor.

The state line allows control over the states:
- In standby, click the state line once to start a new process.
- In any state, click and hold the state line to return to standby.
- In any state, double-click to skip the current state and force the next (not recommended for regular operation).
